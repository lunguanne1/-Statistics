# Statistics Project 2025

This repository contains our university project for the **Statistics** course.  
The project includes several problems that involve both **theoretical concepts** and **practical simulations in Python**.

## Authors
- Maria-Doina Fîrțală – Team leader  
- Jasmin-Ana-Maria Scurtu  
- Daria Cristiana Țăranu 
- Anne-Marie Lungu  

## Project structure
- **Problem 1** – Simulation of passengers and revenue estimation using probability distributions.  
- **Problem 2** – Study of classical distributions (Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, Beta, Chi²) with code, plots, and maximum likelihood analysis.  
- **Problem 3** – Application of probability distributions on simulated datasets, including visualization and interpretation of results.  

## Key methods
- Random variable generation (Bernoulli, Poisson, Uniform, etc.)  
- Simulation of monthly passengers and revenue based on tickets/season passes  
- Visualization of distribution shapes and comparison with theoretical expectations  
- Implementation in Python with functions for detailed data simulation  

## Outputs
The project provides:  
- Code implementations for each distribution  
- Graphical representations (histograms, probability functions)  
- Tables and simulated datasets  
- Interpretation of statistical properties (mean, variance, probability of events)  

## Conclusions
Through this project, we explored how probability distributions can be used to model real-life phenomena such as passenger flows and revenue estimation. The results highlight both the theoretical properties of the distributions and their practical applicability through simulation.
